# Mapping Education & Disability Inequities in Poverty Across Illinois Communities
## Analyzing How Education and Disability Status Shape Economic Outcomes


Educational attainment is widely considered a pathway to economic mobility, yet disabled adults experience persistently higher poverty rates even when they achieve the same levels of schooling as non-disabled peers. This study examines how disability modifies the economic returns to education in Illinois by combining tract-level American Community Survey (ACS) estimates with individual-level ACS Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) records. Tract-level ACS data were used for exploratory spatial analysis to identify geographic patterns in poverty, disability prevalence, and education, revealing concentrated disadvantages in rural and post-industrial regions. To quantify compounding effects at the individual level, statistical modeling was performed using PUMS data, which contains the person-level attributes necessary to evaluate how disability interacts with education, work limitations, and demographic factors. Linear regression, logistic classification, and geographically weighted regression demonstrated that disability remains a strong positive predictor of poverty, even after controlling for education and employment. These results show that education alone does not eliminate the structural barriers disabled adults face, highlighting the need for targeted workforce and accessibility policies that align with ADA objectives.
